INTRODUCTION:
Cafe Management System is a windows form application developed in C++ programming language by Bjarne Stroustrup to carry out and manage basic cafe operations efficiently. This win application is perfect for a cafe or small coffee shop owners and administration who need an application to run and simply ease out their day-to-day managerial tasks. Using this application, one can select a menu or items within its quantity. They can also calculate the total cost of their customer. Similarly, the cafe management system also can generate a bill/receipt, and one can save, edit, or delete their bill within their computer anywhere they like. The Café Management system reduces manual work and improves efficiency and the rate of work. This software helps to take food orders and display them. 
 
 
 
BACKGROUND AND WORKING OF PROJECT: 
Café Management System is based on the concept of ordering food items and generating total food cost. The user can make an order by selecting from the main menu. This mini project contains limited features, but the essential one. Talking about the features of the food ordering system, the system displays a menu of all food items with their prices and the user has to select any of them to order. There should be one order at a time. After selecting, an order the system asks whether to add more items and then proceeds to the quantity of that item. After all these, the system saves the order and asks whether to add another order or not. Then the system generates the bill for the customer. At last, a bill receipt is displayed with the bill number and the total bill amount in rupees. 
 
 
2.	SCOPE OF PROJECT: 
 
The project titled “CAFÉ MANAGEMENT SYSTEM” is designed with Visual Studio. The café owner has to maintain records of daily billing, which will be used to manage sale reports. There will be many items available in the café, many customers will be coming at different times for having food, they will be selecting items from the displayed menu and their bills will be generated. This system will save time and will be easy to use when compared to manual work that was done on paper.

3.	PROJECT PLAN: 
Project planning is a discipline addressing how to complete a project in a certain timeframe, usually with defined stages and designated resources. One view of project planning divides the activity into these steps: 
 Setting measurable objectives 
 Identifying deliverables 
 Scheduling 
 Planning tasks 
Project planning is important at every phase of a project. It lays out the basics of a project, including the following: 
 Scope 
 Objectives 
 Goals 
 Schedule 
 
The following table shows how we planned our project: 
 	Task Name 	Duration 
1 	Planning 	5 days 
2 	Documentation 	2 days 
3 	Coding 	6 days 
4 	Testification 	6 days
 
 
 
Project managers can use planning to turn an abstract idea into a practical reality. The following are some of the most important planning goals: 
•	Project staff by facilitating communication and providing a consolidated source of information. 
•	Assist the project sponsor and other key stakeholders in understanding the requirements. 
•	Determine who will undertake activities, as well as when and how they will be completed. 
•	As the project continues, it will be easier to oversee and control the project. 
•	Allow for effective project monitoring and control. 
 
 
1)	To place an order: 
Order will be taken from the customer, after placing the order the customer will be asked whether they want to make changes to the order. After editing the order, the bill will be displayed accordingly. Only one order will be placed at a time. 
2)	To add an item: 
The staff members can make changes to the menu i.e., they can add and remove items displayed in the menu list, for adding items in the present menu, they will have to type a specific code for that specific item and then enter the price for that specific item and press enter to add that specific item in the menu. 
3)	Edit item: 
Similarly, the items in the present menu can be edited from the menu i.e., changes can be made in the quantity or amount of the items present in the menu.  
4)	Delete an item: 
The items present in the menu can be removed. The user will have to enter the code of that specific item to remove it from the menu.  
5)	Display menu and billing: 
For displaying the menu to the customer, the staff will have to press the required option so that menu is displayed along with the prices. After displaying the menu, the user will select the items to place an order after that a bill receipt will be provided to the customer according to the items present in the list. 
 
 
 
6.	STAKEHOLDERS: 
In the café industry, there are three different stakeholder groups: restaurant owners, managers, and customers. According to stakeholder theory, different stakeholders in a firm may have a vested interest in certain elements of operations based on their preferences. 
A stakeholder in the café management system is someone who has a connection to or interest in the project. "A person, group, or company that is directly or indirectly involved in the project and who may affect or be affected by the project's conclusion" is what the phrase Software Project Stakeholder refers to. 
In the café management system, the following are the stakeholders and intended audience of this project: 
1)	Employees (baristas, partners) 
2)	Customers 
3)	Suppliers (supply firms, coffee farmers) Environment 
 
In the café industry, there are three different stakeholder groups: Café owners, managers, and customers. According to stakeholder theory, different stakeholders in a firm may have a vested interest in certain elements of operations based on their preferences. 
Non-governmental organizations, environmental groups, industrial groups, food manufacturers, policymakers, risk managers, and public and private research are all major stakeholder groups in food and food safety. 
Stakeholders help your firm in both practical and financial ways. Stakeholders include everyone interested in your company, from employees to loyal customers and investors. They boost the number of people who are invested in your company's success, making you feel less alone in your efforts. 
 
 EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS IN THE CAFÉ: 
External stakeholders are those who are not employees of the company. They are neither insiders nor direct employees of the company. They do, however, play a significant part in the company. 
 Customers: They require a positive interaction with those who purchase the product. They are a cafe's primary source of revenue. 
Costumes play an important role in this system as a stakeholder. They help the organization build the economy by purchasing their products. 
 
 INTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS IN THE CAFÉ: 
Internal stakeholders are who run the administration, they are closely related to the administration, and they work every bit twenty-four hours to twentyfour hours of operation. So, they are the interior of the eating house. Internal stakeholders of this eating house are. 
The employees and managers look after the whole organization, serve the customers, and perform all the actions. 
The suppliers supply all the food materials and ingredients to the café. They play the role of a collaborator with the association by providing all the stuff to them in time. 
7.	DELIVERABLES: 
 The current system cannot display a total sales report, but the proposed system will. 
 The current system does not allow you to search for a specific bill; however, the proposed system will allow you to do so. 
 The existing system is not yet user-friendly, whereas the suggested system is. 
 Control and performance have improved.  
 The system was created to address current concerns and problems with taking meal orders and billing.  It has lowered the amount of time spent on it.  
 The accuracy of the bills has improved.  
 Creating bills is now much easier than before.  
 It is simpler to place a customer's food order.  
 Records kept on computers are more secure than those kept on paper. 
 	 
8.	CONCLUSION: 
 Finally, this effort aids in the preservation of any restaurant or café record. It is a sophisticated and user-friendly interface that will handle all of the café's orders and menu. It aids in the taking of orders, the display of orders, and the presentation of bills. This also enables the addition, deletion, and modification of items, as well as the display of menus. 
 It aids in the ordering of meals, which leads to the generating of bills. It will assist various establishments in taking food orders. 
 It facilitates communication with consumers and allows users to produce bills based on the number of food items consumed.  
 The goal of this initiative is to create a simple meal ordering system that can be used in tiny spaces.
